# Apparel-Store-Annual-Report (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
I have build a comprehensive dashboard project in Excel, creating multiple pivot tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

## Project Objective
An Apparel store wants to create an annual sales report for 2024. So that, the owner of the store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2025.
